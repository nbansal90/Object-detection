# Object-detection
Object Detection With Multiscaling Testing with FPN/RCNN

The base repositry has been taken from: https://github.com/jwyang/fpn.pytorch, which using an FPN based network, 
using a RCNN mechanism for Object detection for PASCAL VOC DATASET.

Changes:

1) The Code here is with respect to Drone Dataset, which is differnt from PASCAL VOC Dataset, and has 11 classes.

2) The code addds Multiscale testing, to the existing design, and makes necesaary changes in test code flow.
